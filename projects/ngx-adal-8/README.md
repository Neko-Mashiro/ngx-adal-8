# Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) wrapper for (Angular X)

This library is a wrapper taking consideration different scenarios of how ADAL should be used with Angular 2+ without importing adal-angular in package.json


Reason:
You do not need to install  "adal-angular": "^1.0.17" 
This library is composed of adal.js and adal-angular.js

adal-angular.js is the library for AngularJS meaning anything prior to Angular 2
adal.js is where the code we need is however since we need this file included in more than 
one place installing this library is just plain redundant as we will still need to link 
directly to adal.js and Microsoft put it in their CDN for us or you could host it in your assets folder.

https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com/lib/1.0.17/js/adal.min.js

Sample App using this library at https://github.com/fairmutex/ngx-adal-8-sample


Registering Angular application with Azure can be found [here](http://wpblog.fairmutex.com/2019/06/15/registering-an-angular-app-with-azure/)   
Take note of Application (client) ID (6) and Directory (tenant) Id (7)

In your angular.json under build section add "src/frameRedirect.html" as shown below to make it servable without triggering angular routing.

```bash
            "assets": [
              "src/favicon.ico",
              "src/assets",
              "src/frameRedirect.html"
            ],
``` 
Create frameRedirect.html under src folder and inside frameRedirect.html

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Frame Redirect</title>
    <script src="https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com/lib/1.0.17/js/adal.min.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
    <script>
        var adalConfig = {
            clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID (6)"
        };
        var authContext = new AuthenticationContext(adalConfig);
        authContext.handleWindowCallback();

        if (window === window.parent) { window.location.replace(location.origin + location.hash); }
    </script>
</body>

</html>
``` 

In index.html put

```html
<script src="https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com/lib/1.0.17/js/adal.min.js"></script>
``` 

In app.module.ts 

```bash
import { NgxAdalModule } from 'ngx-adal-8';
``` 

Imports section

```typescript
NgxAdalModule.forRoot({
      tenant: `YOUR_TENANT_ID (7)`,
      clientId: `YOUR_CLIENT_ID (6)`,
      redirectUri: `frameRedirect.html`, 
      postLogoutRedirectUri: `frameRedirect.html`, 
      cacheLocation: 'localStorage',
    }),
``` 

3 App scenerios


App that either you are logged in or will send you to login upon visit 

Without using guards

in your app.component.ts

```typescript
import {NgxAdalService} from 'ngx-adal-8';
``` 

```typescript
  constructor(private authService:NgxAdalService){
    if (!this.authService.isAuthenticated) {
      this.authService.login();
    }    
  }
``` 


Using guards


In app-routing.module.ts

```typescript

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';

const routes: Routes = [
    { path: '', component: AppComponent, pathMatch:'full', canActivate: [NgxAdalGuard]}
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }

```

App that have public facing and some parts require login.
In some component perhaps navbar.component.ts login/logout buttons

```typescript
  login(){
    this.authService.login();
  }

  logout(){
    this.authService.logout();
  }
``` 

Then use guards on the specific children routes.
